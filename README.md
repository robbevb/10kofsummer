# 10 kilobytes of summer

10kofsummer was made with Sass, Compass and some manual minifying. Svg's are ridiculously optimized, class and file names are unsementically short and everything is minified to a single line. I managed to squeeze the site into 8868 bytes.

Have fun playing my little 10k game!
