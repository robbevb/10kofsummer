# 10 kilobytes of summer

Feeling like summer has been gone fot too long already? 10kofsummer is a little HTML and CSS only game to get you back in a summery mood.

## Technologies

The project was made with Sass, Compass and SVG's. The CSS is compressed and unreadable, but I'm including the Sass files for reference.

As for the HTML, the class names are quite unsementic to reduce bytes. I did try to make it as accessible as possible.

The SVG's are ridiculously optimized to reduce file size. Think of removing excess anchors and handles, rounding all the numbers to integers and converting polygons to paths for shorter syntaxes.

JS is deliberately left out because I felt like it would hog up too much of the allowed size. I used keyframes and some smart selectors to animate the page and make the game interactive.
